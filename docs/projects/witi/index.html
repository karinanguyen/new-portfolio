    <p><a href="https://citris-uc.org/research/edge-in-tech-initiative/">WiTI</a> envisions a world in which under-included communities are proportionately represented and equitably compensated throughout the professional ranks in the tech industry and academia.</p>
<p>Together we the Program Director and CITRIS Executive Director, we have developed branding for the Women in Tech Initiative.</p>
<p>The notion of diversity was at the core of the mission statement of the center. Diversity in the technical workforce at all levels enhances collective intelligence and innovation. An information-based society thrives with a vibrant intellectual ecosystem. Industry benefits financially, and technologists enjoy career longevity sustained by personal and professional satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>WITI@UC brings together faculty, staff, and students from a range of disciplines and multiple campuses to work in partnership with executives, board members, investors, entrepreneurs, and career technologists in the technology industry — all committed to promoting an inclusive and equitable environment for women in technical fields.</p>
<h2 id="logo">Logo</h2>
<p>Our logo design was based on these three key concepts: diversity, intellectual ecosystem (innovation), and career longevity. After several iterations, we decided on bringing the neutral and cool blue color with the smooth gradient and natural flow for the logotype.  </p>
