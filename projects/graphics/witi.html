                        The notion of diversity was at the core of the mission statement of the center. Diversity in the technical workforce at all levels enhances collective intelligence and innovation. An information-based society thrives with a vibrant intellectual ecosystem. Industry benefits financially, and technologists enjoy career longevity sustained by personal and professional satisfaction.

                        Our logo design was based on these three key concepts: diversity, intellectual ecosystem (innovation), and career longevity. After several iterations, we decided on bringing the neutral and cool blue color with the smooth gradient and natural flow for the logotype.
